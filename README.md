This project, carried out by myself and Lorenzo Gargasole and Guillermo Jos√® Gallucci, is a Semantic Segmentation project, in which we train various networks (Bisenet and DeepLabV2) on images from the game GTA V,
then validate them on real life images, then with DataAugmentation and Domain Shift techniques (FDA and DACS) validate until we obtain an accuracy of about 32% maximum validating on real life images
